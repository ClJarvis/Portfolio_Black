# Portfolio

A portfolio page for showing the projects I have built while a Student at Nashville Software School. Some projects are class directed others are independent projects. These projects were built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS and Json.
The page also conatians my contact information, my social netwrk links, and a list of skills.

The portfolio page is HTML5, CSS, and bootstrap.
